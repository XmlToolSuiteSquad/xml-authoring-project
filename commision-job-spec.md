I have a composer project which acts as a structured folder containing Xml files in known locations. 

In the root of my structured folder I have a configuration file.

In the configuration file are settings pointing to various files and folders on Google Drive

I run `composer update` to ensure all the dependent tools are loaded via composer package management.

Then I run a `ConvertInventoryFileToXml` command which does the following:


# ConvertInventoryFileToXml
